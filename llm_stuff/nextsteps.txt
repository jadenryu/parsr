i want to implement rag within my search engine for the summarizer.

first, i will use qdrant for the vector database. i need to also use a sentence transformer to embed the soruces.

here is how the workflow goes. 
the user asks a query and it is transformed into a vector, which is then queried into the vector db to retrieve semantically
relevant results. using rag, i want to incorporate the text in vectors returned in my ai summary. however, i only 
want research papers in my vector db to ensure non bias and improved accuracy. 

i realize i need to also need api keys and manual information to make this happen. can you let me know about
the next steps in text form?
